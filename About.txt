First, thanks alot for your help. I've learned alot from you in the last few days.

I took the things you showed me and created a dummy control to apply what I've learned. 
The ultimate goal is to create a CustomControl and be able to give it to other developers, 
and have them be able to restyle all or some of it.

So, in the Generic.xaml I have the basic styles created. Then in the MainWindow I
created (and commented out) some override styles. You can uncomment those & see
the effect. That is (I think) what I'm looking for, the ability to restyle it -  
I just want to be sure I'm going about this right.

One other question I have - What if I wanted to create and ship two different styles,
say Light and Dark. I assume I need two different style dictionaries that get applied
in Generic.xaml, but I don't know what that looks like. Then, how can the end developer
apply one of those?

Again, thanks.

Kevin
